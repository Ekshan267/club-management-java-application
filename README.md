# club-management-java-application
hello guys its a club management java application created using eclipse.
In this project you can add/update/delete club members and manage club events ( here basically i add only aero,lambda,infero,torque java forms in application).
(A prototype of this i created for football teams can be viewed on https://youtu.be/4Ck3QQm6FUA 
and its database is created using MySQL which u can see on https://youtu.be/b89UIyK2MXU)
Important:
you can import files from master and open it with eclipse to make changes in my project.
Main codes and form can be found on "src folder"
you can use mysqlconnector for jdbc to connect ur MySql database with eclipse.
I hope you can see my videos of prototype project of this to get idea or open this project in eclipse to see/ and modify my project
